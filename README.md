<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use LogisticHelper, run the `neuralLogistics.py` script. This script will process the data and use a neural network model for predictions.

### In-Depth Example Usage: Model Training
This example outlines the steps involved in training the LogisticHelper's neural network model. It's important to note that this example focuses on the model training aspect of the LogisticHelper.

1. **Define Categorical and Numerical Columns**
   - The script starts by identifying the categorical (e.g., 'ProductName', 'FORMAT') and numerical columns (e.g., 'Amount') for data preprocessing.

2. **Specify Model Path**
   - A path is set for saving or loading the trained model, such as 'my_model.h5'.

3. **Load and Preprocess Data**
   - Data is loaded and preprocessed using specific functions, requiring the dataset path and the defined columns.

4. **Model Training/Evaluation or Loading**
   - The script checks for an existing trained model. If not found, it proceeds to train a new model using the preprocessed data.

5. **Prepare Prediction Data**
   - New data for prediction is prepared, ensuring it matches the format of the training data.

6. **Make Predictions**
   - The preprocessed prediction data is then used with the trained model to make predictions.

This example demonstrates the model training process, from data preparation to prediction. It's a crucial part of LogisticHelper's functionality, focusing on how the neural network model is trained and utilized for making predictions.
